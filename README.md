ABSTRACT:
In our project, we are creating an Image Classification Model specifically designed for Indian Monuments. 
Our approach involves a Random Forest Classifier which is a Machine Learning algorithm, which enables us to predict the name of a monument given an input image.
Our model is integrated with a web framework using the Flask module, where users can upload an image of an Indian monument.
The uploaded image is then processed by our model, and the predicted label of the monument is displayed as the output. 
This provides an user-friendly interface for users to explore and identify Indian monuments.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem addressed in this project is the classification of Indian monument images using machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Randomized Cross-Validation (CV).


INTRODUCTION:
In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence and computer vision, image classification has witnessed tremendous advancements in recent years.
With the advent of powerful deep learning algorithms and sophisticated image recognition techniques, machines have become remarkably adept at recognizing and categorizing visual data. 
However, as we embark on our project “INDIAN MONUMENT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ”, we believe that it is essential to explore the foundational principles of machine learning before delving into the complexities of deep learning.
Although deep learning algorithms have demonstrated astonishing accuracy results in image classification tasks, we firmly believe in a systematic approach towards understanding the underlying concepts before adopting more complex models. 
We tested different Machine Learning Algorithms like Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.
Through extensive testing, we have observed that the Random Forest Classifier outperforms the SVM model in terms of test accuracy and computation speed.
 However, to further improve the accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier, we have fine-tuned its hyperparameters using Randomized Search Cross Validation.
In addition, we have employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. By reducing the dimensionality of the input data, PCA helps to extract the most important features and discard less relevant information. 
This approach enhances the model's efficiency and accuracy by focusing on the most informative aspects of the image data.
By incorporating these techniques into our project, we aim to develop an efficient model for classifying and predicting monuments from images.

-Data collection and Preprocessing
